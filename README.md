# Electronic Notebook: Title goes here

Template for Notebooks for Supporting Information and Zenodo Deposition.

## Layout

Description of the directory layout.

- `README.md` This is the file you're viewing right now.
- `environment.yml` Defines the required Python packages using conda. Try to pin to specific major versions of your
  dependencies as their behavior may change in the future.
  The environment is currently called `my_environment` and you'll likely want to rename it to something less generic.
- `.zenodo.json` metadata for Zenodo.
- `pyproject.toml` and `github/workflows/ruff.yml` sets up ruff linting for Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Delete if not relevant to your project.

## Requirements

To run the Notebooks online, click on the _Launch Binder_ badge above. Alternatively, to run on your own computer,
install Python using _e.g._ [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io)
and make sure all required packages are loaded by issuing the following terminal commands

``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate my_environment
jupyter-lab
```

## Checklist - delete before publishing

- [ ] Add authors incl. ORCID's and other relevant metadata to `.zenodo.json`; to learn more about the available datafields, see
  [here](https://developers.zenodo.org/?python#depositions).
  Before publishing, validate the JSON file using the Zenodo deposition schema [`legacyrecord.json`](https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/blob/482ee72ad501cbbd7f8ce8df9b393c130d1970f7/zenodo/modules/deposit/jsonschemas/deposits/records/legacyrecord.json#L4) with _e.g._
  ``` bash
  pip install check-jsonschema
  check-jsonschema --schemafile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenodo/zenodo/master/zenodo/modules/deposit/jsonschemas/deposits/records/legacyrecord.json .zenodo.json
  ```
- [ ] Update Binder badge to point to your repository
- [ ] Add the Github repo link and DOI of the associated publication to `.zenodo.json` under `related_identifiers`.
- [ ] Update `environment.yml` to include required packages. Select name for environment.
- [ ] If needed, change the license (`LICENSE` and badge in `README.md`), see _e.g._ [Creative Commons alternatives](https://github.com/santisoler/cc-licenses)
- [ ] Activate Github tracking of the repository on https://zenodo.org. Repository must be public.
- [ ] Create a release on Github - adhere to [SemVer](https://semver.org). This triggers a deposition on Zenodo.
- [ ] Once you get the Zenodo DOI, add a badge to the top if this README. Use link to _all_ versions.
- [ ] Feel free to update and make new releases!
